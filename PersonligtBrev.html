                <p><strong>Personal Letter - From Groundsman/Facility Manager to System Developer</strong></p>
                <p>I am currently in my first year as a System Developer.NET student at Campus in Varberg. 
                    My studies encompass a range of subjects including C#, .NET, SQL, HTML, and CSS. From November 2024 to February 2025, I will embark on my first internship but before that I will have completed the following courses: 
                    <p></p>Agile System Development in Teams, 
                    Advanced .NET, Advanced System Development with ASP.NET, Database Development and Administration, Object-Oriented Programming, 
                    System Testing for Frontend Developers, Web Development, and Development with C#.
                    <p></p>

                    Prior to pursuing my career change, I worked as a Groundsman at Falkenbergs Kommun. 
                    In this role, I undertook various tasks, including maintaining high-level grass areas for a top-tier football team, managing ice care at Falkenbergs Icehall, and organizing events. 
                    Additionally, I handled customer relationships and served as a public face for our organization. Tasks such as tree cutting and tractor operation were also part of my responsibilities.
                    <p></p>

                    I consider myself to be open-minded and sociable. 
                    I easily integrate into new groups and connect with people from diverse backgrounds. I have a strong drive for learning and achieving goals, and I am deeply passionate about the subjects I study and work on. When I'm not occupied with work or studies, I cherish spending quality time with my family and friends.<p>
                    
                    Best regards, <strong>Isac Elfstrand</strong>
